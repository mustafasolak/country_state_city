# country_state_city
This repo contains world country, state and city records in JSON and SQL format.
I simplified data in repo which is below. I just needed country name, phone code, emojiU and native columns for countries, name and state code for state, name for city . 
So I wrote a php script to select data from data provided by dr5hn.


Thanks to dr5hn.
